<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- this is my default html -->

<html lang="eng">
  <head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">   
   <meta charset="utf-8">
       <meta name="author" content="">
      <meta name="viewport" 
content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
   <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- html's modern concerns are creating custom interfaces which are semantic and 
accessible, improving performance with attributes and tooling, organizing  
code for reuse and maintainability

html5 in 2008 provided new elements to maintain document semantics
so you wouldn't need <div class="navbar"> but could use <nav role="navigation">
and <section class="grid">, <article>, <footer>, <main>

WAI-ARIA, which stands for “Web Accessibility Initiative — Accessible Rich Internet Applications”
aria-label="search"> <- you would put this in e.g. as placeholder is only human readable
      <form>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
It isn't essential, it's just a semantic tag.

Using css frameworks requires the user to download the whole framework... 
That can be very big with all the js.
So people often optimize it by putting all js <script> tags out of the <head>
and at the end of the <body> (as in bootstraps' starter template)
  - but you can instead use the -defer- attribute to a <script> letting the browser
render the DOM from the html _while downloading the js! ( <script defer src= ... </script>
  - async and rel="preload" for <link> also let you govern the order things come out in
  - linking images locally instead of from another site optimize performance
you can also resize them to lower resolutions:
<img class="img-fluid" src="microsoft-logo-small.png" srcset="microsoft-logo-medium.png 
1000w, microsoft-logo-large.png 2000w" alt="microsoft logo">
the -srcset- attribute tells the browser to load the right one based on browser
width.

#minification of JS and CSS - a program analyzes and removes unnecesary data
from code (parts of frameworks not used, extra spaces, making variables single
characters...)
  - it is what makes super ugly unreadable solidblocks of JS.
  - often cuts 70% of file size!

# critical css - a tool identifies the most important elements of a page
and shrinks them together: https://github.com/addyosmani/critical or
https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/
  you can e.g. have a 12kb file with all necesary JS and CSS
  - it lets you use rel="preload" to load things asynchronously! thus faster

# all of these things are done in a build step
- minify html css js
- concatenate js and css
- inline critical css
- optimize images (resize, remove metadata)
webpack is one tool for this

##### server templates
head.php contains the <head> element, header.php has the navbar, footer.php...
are combined with index.php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <?php include("head.php");?>
  </head>
  <body>
    <?php include("header.php");?>
    <main role="main">
      <section class="jumbotron">
        ...
      </section>
      <section class="container">
        ...
      </section>
    </main>
    <?php include("footer.php");?>
  </body>
</html>

letting you have barebones html templates and not need to repeat yourself
  - you can change the header just by changing the header.php file!
  (there is a build step which turns include() into html from those files...)
  they can be built during the build step, or they can be rendered by the server
and then sent to the client! This makes dynamic html.
      (if you google "bannanas" google wont send you a unique html already saved,
but will render a new one)

Template rendered by the server is done with
- php
- erb
- ruby on rails
- django (has a django template languages)
- ejs - node's express framework

static generators which wont render (i.e. you dont need a database)
- jekyll
- hugo
- gatsby

# web components
- built on the client, not the server
- create reusable widgets (navbar component, header component...) combine with:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <navbar-component></navbar-component>
    <main role="main">
      <jumbotron-component></jumbotron-component>
      <section class="container">
        <articles-component></articles-component>
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer-component></footer-component>
  </body>
</html>

# # # # ## these custom elements are defined with JS: # # # # # ##

window.customElements.define(
  "navbar-component",
  class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      this.innerHTML = `
        <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light" role="navigation">
          <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
            <li class="nav-item active">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Info</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <form class="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0">
            <input class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="text" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
            <button class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit">Search</button>
          </form>
        </nav>
       `;
    }
  }
);

Components are cool because  you can make something like:
<video width="320" height="240" controls loop muted>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href="movie.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
    which won't affect styles or functionality of the site
so you can copy paste anywhere without issue

  - you can use the shadow DOM to style the custom element with css
which only affects it
  - html templates - write component jtml in a <template> tag
which wont get rendered until JS calls it: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
  - html imports - have navbar-component.html with html, css, js
which is called into the main html file like css:
<link rel="import" href="navbar-component.html">
