###### parts
- .git directory holds configs, logs, branches, head etc.
- working tree - working directory of the repo
- index - staging area, separates working free from git repo
- branch - a pointer to the last commit you made
- commit - snapshot of a set of changes to the working tree (you added 5 files, removed 2)
- tag - marks a specific history point (used to mark release points v1.0 etc.)
- HEAD - pointer to the current branch. A repo only has 1 HEAD. head is a pointer to any commit
