### interesting or nice stuff to save


#### projects in the back of my mind

- make broken translation game
  - server side rendered, hotwire or? which css to use...? probably go
  - like telephone, but users translate a text into the next language really muddling it up
  - user profiles, points for translation quality/how much they've done (ranking?) pms etc. hypothetically, but why bloat...
  - cool sorting algo, en->sp->en banned, but en->sp->chinese->sp(->en or vice versa) could be ok, as long as broken up
  - how to get enough users?
  - something for people to correct others' translations, maybe? (after its done people can go from the original to each target lang?)
  - use it to crowd source translations of other things?
  - esperanto community could be a good start and https://forum.language-learners.org and reddit subs

- programmin idiom code dictionary?
  - analyze people's github code - e.g. find most commonly used functions or patterns in relation to which libraries, what they're used next to...

- nat lang processing - to write and interpret comments and articles
  - smmry.com - Maybe uses Stanford nlp module to process words, then tf-idf algo to find key phrases - term frequency - inverse document frequency analyzes word count, the more frequent the word, the more importanat (but normalize with the inverse you get from a body of documents, to control for conjunctions etc.) probably easy/fast to implement

- do markov chain links function similarly to neurons in neural nets? what kind of overly complex markov chains can be made? can they be applied to finance too, if x moves, y will too... "people should research outdated technology just to see what more can be done with it"

#### what i like
- go
  - does just what it needs to, comfy, easy, simple
- lisp (scheme and common)
  - divine
  - but hardware's built to optimize c's progeny
- Haskell
- J
- unikernels
- plan9 & inferno
- solaris
  
  
  # interesting things for later
  - learn nim? zig?
