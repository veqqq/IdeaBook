### interesting or nice stuff to save


#### projects in the back of my mind

- broken translation game
  - server side rendered, hotwire or? which css to use...? probably go
  - like telephone, but users translate a text into the next language really muddling it up
  - user profiles, points for translation quality/how much they've done (ranking?) pms etc. hypothetically, but why bloat...
  - cool sorting algo, en->sp->en banned, but en->sp->chinese->sp(->en or vice versa) could be ok, as long as broken up
  - how to get enough users?
  - something for people to correct others' translations, maybe? (after its done people can go from the original to each target lang?)
  - use it to crowd source translations of other things?
  - esperanto community could be a good start and https://forum.language-learners.org and reddit subs

- web scrapping
  - reddit bots analyzing stocks, analyzing news articles (especially arctic and central asia) by author, comment quality/size, etc. to get a statistical image of the field
  - colly lib - go
  - analyze people's github code - e.g. find most commonly used functions, libraries, what they're used next to...
  - rod lib - go
  - scrapy - py (makes crawlers/spiders) - beautifulsoup is basically just a parser
- nat lang processing - to write and interpret comments and articles
  - smmry.com - Maybe uses Stanford nlp module to process words, then tf-idf algo to find key phrases - term frequency - inverse document frequency analyzes word count, the more frequent the word, the more importanat (but normalize with the inverse you get from a body of documents, to control for conjunctions etc.) probably easy/fast to implement
- automate commits and random activity here to inflate rankings - or would it be spam? probably no one cares either way

- do markov chain links function similarly to neurons in neural nets? what kind of overly complex markov chains can be made? can they be applied to finance too, if x moves, y will too... "people should research outdated technology just to see what more can be done with it"

#### what im doing
- go
  - does just what it needs to, comfy, easy, simple
- lisp
  - so sexy, y industry no like
- python
  - too many nice libraries
- (minimal) bash, yaml, html, css, json, markdown etc.
  - why the !@#@ did that guy make a trading algo in bash... At least markdown isnt turning complete
