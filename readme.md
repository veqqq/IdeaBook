### interesting or nice stuff to save


#### projects in the back of my mind

- web scrapping
  - reddit bots analyzing stocks, analyzing news articles (especially arctic and central asia) by author, comment quality/size, etc. to get a statistical image of the field
  - colly lib - go
  - analyze people's github code - e.g. find most commonly used functions, libraries, what they're used next to...
  - rod lib - go
  - scrapy - py (makes crawlers/spiders) - beautifulsoup is basically just a parser
- nat lang processing - to write and interpret comments and articles
  - smmry.com
- automate commits and random activity here to inflate rankings - or would it be spam? probably no one cares either way

#### what im doing
- go
  - does just what it needs to, comfy, easy, simple
- lisp
  - so sexy, y industry no like
- python
  - too many nice libraries
- (minimal) bash, yaml, html, css, json, markdown etc.
  - why the !@#@ did that guy make a trading algo in bash... At least markdown isnt turning complete
