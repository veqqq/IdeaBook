## Things consultants say

80/20: refers to the Pareto Principle, a rule stating that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In consulting, this term is most commonly used to refer to the fact that 80% of your results will come from 20% of your work, so you can get to a significant chunk of an answer without having full information about the problem. You have to realize when you’ve reached the 80/20 point and move on to the next part of your project.

actionable: something that can be acted upon or can be done. For example: “That recommendation is not actionable because we do not have the managerial talent to implement it.”

as-is: describes the present state of an organization’s process, culture, and/or capabilities. See “to-be”.

at the end of the day: a phrase used to attempt summarization, introduce an air of finality and perhaps close off certain avenues of discussion; since most consultants’ days do not end with the setting of the sun. “At the end of the day” most of them are still working.

bandwidth: capacity, free time, ability to do (additional) work; generally used to indicate that speaker cannot or would not prefer to do additional work, as in: “I don’t think I’ll have any bandwidth this Friday”.

best of breed: something that is considered superior to its substitutes; can apply to many things in consulting.

blanks: PowerPoint slides that are drawn on a notepad. Senior consultants often draw out a presentation yet to be drafted by “blanking” a series of slides and giving them to a junior consultant to perform the work required to complete them and make them attractive.

blue ocean: a metaphor for the wider and deeper potential of a market that is not yet explored. “I look at the sales opportunities in front of you clowns, and all I see is blue, blue ocean.”

boil the ocean: to embark on an apparently impossible, wasteful, or fruitless task, usually preceded by an exhortation not to, as in: “Let’s not boil the ocean here, an 80/20 should be enough”; this term suggests that the amount of effort to be expended is not worth the potential payoff.

boots on the ground: an overly dramatic way to refer to employees sent to work at an off-site location or to find the truth at the client’s site.

bottom up: developing an estimate by starting with the lowest-level assumptions (i.e., LCATs involved, hours per LCAT, and ODCs) and building those all the way up to an estimate.

buckets: categories; this is the extent of this word’s definition, so it remains a mystery why people choose to employ the former term; also used as a transitive verb (bucketize) to mean “categorize”. Other nonsense variations include “rice bowls”, “silos”, and “basket”.

bush league: a baseball reference describing anything amateurish or unprofessional. “That bush league associate hung up on our biggest client while putting him on hold.”

buttoned-up: to indicate that a particular piece of work or analysis is comprehensive, accurate, and capable of withstanding close scrutiny; this is an example of opposite terms with identical meanings.

buttoned-down: see buttoned-up.

buy-in: agreement, support; it is unclear why “buy-in” has come to supplant these terms, as no actual purchasing occurs.

cap sheet: a capability sheet, one-pager, slick sheet, fact sheet. Usually a one-page front and back, colorful, descriptive sheet that describes the company’s capabilities in an area of business development pursuit.

circle back: to follow up with the indicated individuals at a later point in time, usually to review progress on the current topic of discussion; this phrase is somewhat redundant, as it is impossible to trace a circle that does not connect back with itself.

crisp: an adjective indicating that the referenced work or analysis is thorough and complete, perhaps by gastronomical allusion to food that is fully prepared; it is duly noted that crisp objects, while ostensibly finished, are also far more brittle and prone to shattering.

critical path: The key tasks needed in order for a process to achieve a desired result.

deck: a Powerpoint presentation presenting the findings of a project.

deep dive: a detailed analysis of an aspect of the project, also known as a “double click” on an issue. For example, a consultant might need to do extra research on the financials of a certain competitor, or present a more detailed view of a particular country if a company is active across many markets.

development opportunity: a weakness, flaw, or shortcoming that should be rectified, usually by the subsequent suggestion.

directionally correct: essentially wrong. But it means that the analysis is correct in its broad conclusions and don’t get hung up on details.

engagement: a consulting project. Also called a case or a study; and can be broken up by ‘workstreams’.

granular: a detailed level of abstraction; often used in the context of increasing the fineness of the analysis, as in: “We need to get more granular here”.

hands: often prefaced with “client,” indicates the interpersonal skills of an individual in relation to a particular group of people, as in, “That manager sure has great client hands”.

happy path: in the context of software, process, or information modeling, a happy path is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions.

hard stop: used to indicate that after the time indicated, the listeners are on their own, because the person stating that they have a hard stop sure isn’t going to be around to help after that time.

hope you’re doing well: a generally well-intended but insincere interpolation used at the beginning of most voicemails to replace the standard pleasantries that would be present in verbal communications; use of this phrase does not indicate actual interest in the well-being of the recipient; also found with alarming frequency in email.

key: critical, essential, required, important, central; the key analysis is generally the linchpin; often used as a noun, and with such frequency that its significance has been diluted, since everything is now “key”.

LCAT: labor category.

left that open: we haven’t answered that question yet. The real meaning is that we don’t know. In fact until you asked we hadn’t even thought about it. Q:“How will this impact the new product launch?” A:”We’ve left that open.”

let me play this back: said when the listener wants to refract and color the conversation through his or her own perspective, under the pretense of reviewing the transcript of what’s been said; in this manner the listener can pretend he or she is a tape recorder.

LOE: level of effort, an estimate based on the known requirements of a piece of work or engagement. The LOE is commonly made up of the number of hours and LCATs that would be required to do the work.

low-hanging fruit: really ‘quick wins’, the initial opportunities, areas of exploration, etc. that are easiest to cover; intended to evoke visual imagery of fruit-laden trees, suggesting that much remains beyond the lowest boughs.

now we have a better idea of the questions: the next stage of analysis is going to add value. So far, the analysis we just finished is so completely wrong that we can’t even claim it is ‘directionally correct’, or even that we found ‘the right road’. “OK, so we’re going to have to go back and do this again. But at least now we have a better idea of the questions.”

on the beach: a consultant with no dedicated project(s), or “on the bench”. Being “on the beach” rarely indicates free time (much less beach time); rather, being “on the beach” will indicate that for an undetermined period, you will worry constantly about your next long-term project while you’re shuttled from one short-term assignment (such as proposals or ack, writing cap sheets) to the next.

peel the onion: do more analysis. What this usually means is that the consultant hasn’t figured out the client or stakeholder yet so they are not ready to commit to an outcome or direction yet. “We’ll get a better idea of that once we peel the onion a bit more.”

pipe or pipeline: refers to upcoming projects the company may have available (e.g. “What is in the pipe?”).

provide color: a directive that translates roughly to “This is perhaps the most boring thing I have ever read, with the possible exception of certain lengthier legal disclaimers, and even then it’s pretty close”.

push back (verb form) or pushback (noun): formerly the sole domain of airplanes leaving their gates, this term is now used to indicate resistance and/or disagreement, without actually using those terms; this phrase attempts to avoid any negative connotations of controversy.

quick question: the answer will be anything but quick; bizarre since the adjective “quick” is intended, by implication, to be transferred to the answer to said question and does not necessarily have any bearing on the length of the question.

quick win: easy cost savings we can show the client as soon as possible to justify consulting fees, as in “The entire ROI operation is a quick win.”

red ocean: the opposite of a blue ocean. A field or industry or sector that is experiencing heavy competition.

rock star: an individual whose performance in a given area or success at specific endeavors is highly impressive, unique and/or admirable; this appellation is generally used sparingly; although the term is sometimes used frivolously to express purportedly extreme gratitude, as in: “Thanks for picking up my mail for me, you’re a rock star”.

ROI: return on investment.

ROM: rough order of magnitude, is an estimation of a project’s level of effort and cost to complete.

sea change: in between lake change and ocean change. A major shift. For example: “There has been a sea change in the past decade in terms of how retail banks interact with their clients, and how they prioritize customers based on profitability.”

smoke test: preliminary testing to reveal if simple failures are severe enough to (for example) reject a prospective software release. Smoke testing came to software engineering through electrical engineering where it was the term used by electricians after they had wired a whole house or building. They would turn on the circuits and walk around before the drywall or plaster was added to see if any connections were smoking.

sniff test: as in evaluating food for rancidity, this term is used when gauging the viability or reasonableness of a particular analysis; variation, smell test.

socialize: to ask a person or group to gain consensus, agreement, or understanding on a document or idea among a number of people. The word apparently has its origin in the education profession. Socializing is fun. Gaining consensus, agreement, or understanding on a document or idea isn’t fun. For example, “We need to socialize that idea before setting a formal policy.”

space: a market, arena, field of endeavor, or general area, not to be confused with the area beyond Earth’s atmosphere; use of this term usually adds nothing in the way of descriptive value, as in “I don’t think there will be many opportunities in the technology space”.

straw man: a humanoid comprised entirely of the dried above-ground stalks of any of a variety of grasses; also, a construct or idea presented purely for the sake of argument, with the implication that it is not designed to withstand repeated attacks.

sunset: application retirement, also called application decommissioning, is the practice of shutting down redundant or obsolete business applications while retaining access to the historical data.

suspense: the required completion date of a task. It doesn’t make much sense, but the Army likes to keep us in suspense, until it is due.

take the lead on: a clever phrase often used by more experienced consultants when they wish to delegate a menial task, as in: “Why don’t you take the lead on putting together this document,” which may translate to, “I’m lazy and probably not smart or energetic enough to work on this, so go do it”; often appears in utterly irrelevant settings, as in, “Why don’t you take the lead on making dinner reservations for the team,” a manifestly silly request, since one is asked to “take the lead on” something which doesn’t require leadership of anyone and on which they will certainly be working solo.

takeaway: in other settings a British term referring to carry-out food, in consulting this word has been transmogrified to indicate the salient point that should be retained upon the conclusion of the discussion, often prefaced with key.

the right road, but the wrong direction: the analysis is asking the right questions, but the analysis is wrong, and somebody is going to be fired. “We found the right road, but we took the wrong direction.”

to-be: describes the future state; in other words, how an organization’s process, culture, and capabilities will appear in the future after the consultant makes an impact.

to be transparent: in indication that what follows will be particularly revelatory, although it often is not especially so; the troubling implication of this usage is that the speaker has heretofore been opaque.

top down: developing an estimate by starting with the highest-level assumptions and using estimates to drill down to a smaller-level estimate. For example, estimating market size by starting with the number of potential customers and estimating how many purchase the product, how frequently, and at what price points.

touch base: to catch up with someone, typically a person with whom you’ve not had much contact lately. For example: “I’ve been dealing with another client all week and I know I owe you some numbers. We’ll touch base after my afternoon conference call.”

value-add: quite simply, that value is added, mashed into a hyphenated noun form; which is based on the notion of increasing shareholder wealth by contributing to the profitability and therefore value of a firm. Now used to describe anything that “adds value,” (i.e., is positive, productive, and helpful). For example: “Consultants are clearly value-add professionals.”

view from 30,000 feet: a very high-level, preliminary or cursory look at a particular situation, often used to suggest that pertinent details are inappropriately glossed over; however, one never speaks of the view from, say five or six feet, which might be more appropriate given the average height of a human being. Sometimes replaced with “view from 20,000 feet”, or “bird’s eye view”.

watermelon: really ‘low-hanging fruit’ that are ripe and juicy and ready to pick.

weeds: the intricate details of an analysis. Some people love the weeds, others not so much.

white space: an opportunity for company to generate revenue where it is not currently. For example, generating revenue from an existing product in a new market.

wordsmith: to make trivial or generally unnecessary edits to text that may only subtly change the meaning, if at all; incorrectly implies that one is a craftsman on the order of a blacksmith or goldsmith; sadly, wordsmithing rarely involves the deletion of jargon.
